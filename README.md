# Wetterturnier Twitter Bot

A bot to tweet and to advertise the wetterturnier. The idea is the following:

* Congratulate the winners Monday afternoon
* Random (1-2 tweets a weekend) if (a) something cool is going on, e.g,
	* Friday 15 UTC "seems to get quite windy/rainy" "prepare your umbrella if you are in Innsbruck"
	* If nothing is that important, tweet something about "currently leading in"
